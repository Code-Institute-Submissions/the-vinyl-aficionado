<h2>1st Milestone Project</h2>

[View the live project here](https://josecastanocoding.github.io/the-vinyl-aficionado/)

The Vinyl Aficionado is a website aimed to attract vinyl enthusiasts in order to lead them to the purchase of vinyl records, vinyl accessories and/or clothing. 

The Vinyl Aficionado also offers the possibility for potential customers to sign up for a newsletter,  so a database of potential customers can be elaborated and ,furthermore, those who join can be targeted at some stage with promotions and marketing campaigns.

The website has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

## User Experience (UX)

The Vinyl Aficionado partners with [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com), as it provides its visitors with products from the latter site. I can confirm that I own [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com) and that I myself built the site using Wordpress.

The Vinyl Aficionado also counts with another partner to provide clothing items. Such partner is [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/), however this is purely fictional and only used for the educational purpose of adding value to The Vinyl Aficionado. 

I can also confirm that I am not an affiliate of [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/)

## Design

- ### <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

I did some research online and came across an article about the 50 best website color schemes for 2021 - [link here](https://designshack.net/articles/trends/best-website-color-schemes/). I picked a combination of colours that I consider to be eye-catching,
and that it has a certain e-commerce retail finish. 

There are 4 dominant colours that can be identified on my site:

- <strong>Deep emerald (#1FC58E)</strong> : Used as the background colour for the first slide of the carousel, and as the font color of the remaining slides within the carousel.
It is the main background colour of all the pages but the home page. Also used as background colour for all the call-to-action buttons.
- <strong>Color Hex Yellow (#FAE62D)</strong> : Used as the background colour of the first call-to-action button on the first slide of the carousel. It is the colour I used for the borders
of all the images displayed on the following pages: "Home", "About Me" and "Shop".
- <strong>Color Hex Black (#191414)</strong> : Used as the font colour for the text on the first slide of the carousel, headings and subheadings and all the text on the website with the exception of the navigation bar and footer.
- <strong>Radial Gradient</strong> : Used as the background colour of both the navigation bar and footer. Combination used: rgb(126,126,138) + radial-gradient(circle, rgba(126,126,138,1) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,1) 70%, rgba(233,233,233,1) 100%).

Other colours I have used:

- <strong>Color Hex Dark Grey (#777777)</strong> : Used as the font colour for the items of the navigation bar and the items in the footer.
- <strong>Color Hex White (#ffffff)</strong> : Used for the hover effect on all the buttons and for the items included in the dropdown menu of the shop.
- <strong>RGB rgb(220, 224, 212)</strong> : Used as the background colour of the home page section just underneath the carousel slider. 

- ### <h3>Typography</h3>

The font I used for all the website is "Space Grotesk".





- ### <h3>Imagery</h3>

All the images I used for my project can be found in the following [link](https://photos.google.com/u/2/album/AF1QipPOBUIe2thesg1mvdwvRcdRUe9_2owb3LXCp19p) 
Every page of the website has its GitHub folder that contains all the pictures I used.


## Wireframes

All the wireframes I drew can be found in the following [link](https://photos.google.com/u/2/album/AF1QipOiJG6l1mZ5Ftj5CDdoiU8IgjuenrQRaPbL6DVx)


## Features

The site counts with 6 pages in total

### Existing Features

- It is responsive to screen size thanks to bootstrap and the media queries I have put in place.

- The navbar is not fixed to the top of the screen, and collapses into a hamburger button on mobile devices/smartphones.

- The carousel slider on the home page provides the visitors with a nice visual animation, as well as giving them the option to sign up for the newsletter by clicking the button on the first slide.

- There is form validation on subscription form, an alert displays if name or email fields are empty. 

- In the first two sections a call to action button prompts the user to another section. 

- Hover animations are used on the cards (box shadow appears) in the about section and the social media icons (grow in size) in the footer section.

- Contrasting colours and aria labels are used to ensure site supports visually impaired visitors. 

- Some images of trees can be clicked on and the user will be brought to [another site](https://www.curio-eco.com/world/tagged-trees/2538832?lat=53.34427142201096&lng=-6.316257453758462&zml=18) that pinpoints the exact location of the tree.
  
### Features Left to Implement

- Have the subscription form add the visitor details to an email list database.

Once you have the extension on your browser, a green Gitpod button will appear beside this repository in GitHub. For best results fork the repository in your personal account before you open it in Gitpod.

Once you have the completed site in your own repository, you can deploy to GitHub pages by the following steps.

1. On GitHub, go to the completed sites repository.
2. Click on settings, on the settings page scroll down the the GitHub Pages section. 
3. Under GitHub pages, Select the appropriate branch or folder the index.html is in. 
4. Click on save. A message should then appear advising the URL of your deployed site.
