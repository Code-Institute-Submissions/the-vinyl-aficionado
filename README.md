<h1 align="center"><strong>The Vinyl Aficionado</strong></h1>

<h2>1st Milestone Project</h2>

[View the live project here.] https ***

The Vinyl Aficionado is a website aimed to attract vinyl enthusiasts in order to lead them to the purchase of vinyl records, vinyl accessories and/or clothing. 

It is formed of 4 different pages: the Home page, the About Me page, the Shop page (each of the products in such page are linked to another website), 

 and Contact Us. The Vinyl Aficionado partners with therecordbloke.com, as it provides its visitors 

with products from the latter site. I can confirm that I own therecordbloke.com and that I myself built the site using Wordpress.

The Vinyl Aficionado has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops. 

## <h1 align="center"><strong>User Experience (UX)</strong></h1>

## User stories:

-  ### <h3>First Time Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to browse through the catalogue of products and make enquiries for items I want to purchase.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to analyse the site and evaluate how easy it is to navigate throught it in order to check the products and content.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to verify testimonials about the quality of the service and find out what real people think about the website. I will also corroborate
all their social media channels by clicking on the social media icons displayed on the site, with the aim of getting a deeper insight of their followings on each of the social
media platforms they are part of. 


`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
