The Vinyl Aficionado is a website aimed to attract vinyl enthusiasts in order to lead them to the purchase of vinyl records, vinyl accessories and/or clothing. 

The Vinyl Aficionado also offers the possibility for potential customers to sign up for a newsletter,  so a database of potential customers can be elaborated and ,furthermore, those who join can be targeted at some stage with promotions and marketing campaigns.

The website has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

## User Experience (UX)

The Vinyl Aficionado partners with [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com), as it provides its visitors with products from the latter site. I can confirm that I own [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com) and that I myself built the site using Wordpress.

The Vinyl Aficionado also counts with another partner to provide clothing items. Such partner is [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/), however this is purely fictional and only used for the educational purpose of adding value to The Vinyl Aficionado. 

I can also confirm that I am not an affiliate of [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/)

## Design

- ### <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

I did some research online and came across an article about the 50 best website color schemes for 2021 - [link here](https://designshack.net/articles/trends/best-website-color-schemes/). I picked a combination of colours that I consider to be eye-catching,
and that it has a certain e-commerce retail finish. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/PhototasticCollageTVAcolourscheme.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

There are 4 dominant colours that can be identified on my site:

- <strong>Deep emerald (#1FC58E)</strong> : Used as the background colour for the first slide of the carousel, and as the font color of the remaining slides within the carousel.
It is the main background colour of all the pages but the home page. Also used as background colour for all the call-to-action buttons.
- <strong>Color Hex Yellow (#FAE62D)</strong> : Used as the background colour of the first call-to-action button on the first slide of the carousel. It is the colour I used for the borders
of all the images displayed on the following pages: "Home", "About Me" and "Shop".
- <strong>Color Hex Black (#191414)</strong> : Used as the font colour for the text on the first slide of the carousel, headings and subheadings and all the text on the website with the exception of the navigation bar and footer.
- <strong>Radial Gradient</strong> : Used as the background colour of both the navigation bar and footer. Combination used: rgb(126,126,138) + radial-gradient(circle, rgba(126,126,138,1) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,1) 70%, rgba(233,233,233,1) 100%).

Other colours I have used:

- <strong>Color Hex Dark Grey (#777777)</strong> : Used as the font colour for the items of the navigation bar and the items in the footer.
- <strong>Color Hex White (#ffffff)</strong> : Used for the hover effect on all the buttons and for the items included in the dropdown menu of the shop.
- <strong>RGB rgb(220, 224, 212)</strong> : Used as the background colour of the home page section just underneath the carousel slider. 

- ### <h3>Typography</h3>

The font I used for all the website is "Space Grotesk".

<img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/Font.png" width="1000" height="200" />

- ### <h3>Imagery</h3>

All the images I used for my project can be found in the following [link](https://photos.google.com/u/2/album/AF1QipPOBUIe2thesg1mvdwvRcdRUe9_2owb3LXCp19p) 
Every page of the website has its GitHub folder that contains all the pictures I used. 

I used the site [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to download all my images, with the exception of the ones in the page "about me", I own those ones.


## Wireframes

All the wireframes I drew can be found in the following [link](https://photos.google.com/u/2/album/AF1QipOiJG6l1mZ5Ftj5CDdoiU8IgjuenrQRaPbL6DVx)

## Features

The site counts with 6 pages in total. There is a static page (shop) that serves as a dropdown menu, and that contains 3 sub-pages.

### Existing Features

- It is responsive to screen size thanks to bootstrap and the media queries I have put in place.

- The navbar is not fixed to the top of the screen, and collapses into a hamburger button on mobile devices/smartphones.

- The carousel slider on the home page provides the visitors with a nice visual animation, as well as giving them the option to sign up for the newsletter by clicking the button on the first slide.

- There are other 3 call-to-action buttons that can be found on the home page, taking the user to visit all the sections contained in the shop.

- Hover animations are used on the navigation items in the navigation menu (underline from left), and the social media icons (float shadow) in the footer section.

- All the products listed in the page shop, under the categories of vinyl and accessories, are provided via my own website [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com). All the clothing products are provided via another third 
party called [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/). The call-to-action buttons will allow the user to go directly to both sites and place orders. 

### Features left to implement

- Call-to-action on the form located on the page "Contact Us" and submitting details of potential users to a database.

## Testing

 The following tools were utilised to test the website:

 - [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com/)

 The results of such test can be seen as below:

 <img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/loadingspeed.PNG" width="400" height="300" />

 - [W3C CSS Validator - Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
 - [W3C Markup Validator - Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)

 In regards to the HTML markup, I encountered one error that even though it did not affect the functionality of the site, it was marked as non-valid code, see below:

 <img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/errorhtml.PNG" width="1000" height="300" />

 After trying numerous types of fixes, I eventually managed to cut some code from Bootstrap navbar documentation and embedded it onto my existing navbar code I previously extracted from Bootstrap. The problem of a div element being a child of an ul was solved
 by changing the div element by a li, which will perfectly fit as a child of an ul. My original classes and id's were kept as they did not need to change at all.

 In regards to the CSS, no errors. Please see below: 

 <img src="assets/images/readme-images-and-documentation/cssresults.PNG" width="1000" height="300" />

 - [Responsive Web Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

 The website has been tested in various devices and I have also used the dev tools to make sure that the site renders adequately on all the breakpoints.

### Testing User Stories

-  ### <h3>First Time Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to browse through the catalogue of products and make enquiries for items I want to purchase.
        - This has been tested and an user will be more than able to browse through the sections of the shop and select any items, by clicking on the call-to-action buttons to buy the product.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to analyse the site and evaluate how easy it is to navigate throught it in order to check the products and content.
        - Navigation menu works perfectly, and each section has an underline efect to make sure the user sees where he/she goes next. On smaller devices such as smartphones, the menu will toggle and
        still will have all the functionality an user needs.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to verify testimonials about the quality of the service and find out what real people think about the website. I will also corroborate
        all their social media channels by clicking on the social media icons displayed on the site, with the aim of getting a deeper insight of their followings on each of the social
        media platforms they are part of.
        - Testimonials are shown right on the home page, and all the links to social media channels are working accordingly.

-  ### <h3>Returning Visitor Goals</h3>

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I might want to place an order or follow up on an enquiry I recently made.
        - All buttons to buy products are fully working so the user will be more than able to perfom such action.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to check any possible new releases or products available on the website.
        - The website will be updated with new products on a daily basis so users can come back and check the latest releases.
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to keep up with any promotions running via the official social media accounts of The Vinyl Aficionado website.
        - Social media channels will always be available for the users just by clicking on the links provided on the site.

### Bugs and some other challenges    

One of the navigation items (shop) tends to come off the alignment with the rest of the items. I managed to apply some padding and center it with the rest of items. However, I have
noticed that, when being in one of the pages of the shop, the item comes off although we are probably talking a quarter of a cm.

The Carousel slider from bootstrap was challenging and I very much enjoyed breaking down the code and implementing a first slide that will be the main sign of identity of my website, visually speaking.

The markup of my HTML showed (as previously mentioned) a piece of non-valid code. I was able to fix the issue by using the following [Bootstrap navbar documents](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/dropdowns/)

### Final layout

 - Home Page: I introduced the carousel slider instead of a static photo, as per my wireframe I drew back when I was starting the project.
 - Shop: I deployed a dropdown menu with all the sections of the shop, rather than displaying them all on a single page.
