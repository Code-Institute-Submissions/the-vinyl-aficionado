The Vinyl Aficionado also offers the possibility for potential customers to sign up for a newsletter,  so a database of potential customers can be elaborated and ,furthermore, those who join can be targeted at some stage with promotions and marketing campaigns.

The website has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

## User Experience (UX)

The Vinyl Aficionado partners with [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com), as it provides its visitors with products from the latter site. I can confirm that I own [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com) and that I myself built the site using Wordpress.

The Vinyl Aficionado also counts with another partner to provide clothing items. Such partner is [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/), however this is purely fictional and only used for the educational purpose of adding value to The Vinyl Aficionado. 

I can also confirm that I am not an affiliate of [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/)

## Design

- ### <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

I did some research online and came across an article about the 50 best website color schemes for 2021 - [link here](https://designshack.net/articles/trends/best-website-color-schemes/). I picked a combination of colours that I consider to be eye-catching,
and that it has a certain e-commerce retail finish. 

There are 4 dominant colours that can be identified on my site:

- <strong>Deep emerald (#1FC58E)</strong> : Used as the background colour for the first slide of the carousel, and as the font color of the remaining slides within the carousel.
It is the main background colour of all the pages but the home page. Also used as background colour for all the call-to-action buttons.
- <strong>Color Hex Yellow (#FAE62D)</strong> : Used as the background colour of the first call-to-action button on the first slide of the carousel. It is the colour I used for the borders
of all the images displayed on the following pages: "Home", "About Me" and "Shop".
- <strong>Color Hex Black (#191414)</strong> : Used as the font colour for the text on the first slide of the carousel, headings and subheadings and all the text on the website with the exception of the navigation bar and footer.
