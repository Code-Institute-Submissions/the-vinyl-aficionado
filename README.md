The Vinyl Aficionado is a website aimed to attract vinyl enthusiasts in order to lead them to the purchase of vinyl records, vinyl accessories and/or clothing. 

The Vinyl Aficionado also offers the possibility for potential customers to sign up for a newsletter,  so a database of potential customers can be elaborated and ,furthermore, those who join can be targeted at some stage with promotions and marketing campaigns.

The website has been designed to be responsive, intuitive and accessible on a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

## User Experience (UX)

The Vinyl Aficionado partners with [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com), as it provides its visitors with products from the latter site. I can confirm that I own [therecordbloke.com](https://therecordbloke.com) and that I myself built the site using Wordpress.

The Vinyl Aficionado also counts with another partner to provide clothing items. Such partner is [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/), however this is purely fictional and only used for the educational purpose of adding value to The Vinyl Aficionado. 

I can also confirm that I am not an affiliate of [wastedheroes-shop.com](https://www.wastedheroes-shop.com/)

- ### <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

I did some research online and came across an article about the 50 best website color schemes for 2021 - [link here](https://designshack.net/articles/trends/best-website-color-schemes/). I picked a combination of colours that I consider to be eye-catching,
and that it has a certain e-commerce retail finish.
